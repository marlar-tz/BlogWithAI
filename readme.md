## Overview

When the user enters a number, the game will check whether it is equal to the secret number or not. If the number is higher, a hint will be given as 'Too high.' The same applies if the number is lower, with the hint 'Too low.' The score starts at 20, and every time the user makes a wrong guess, 1 point is deducted. To reset the game, the user can click the 'Again' button.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- enter number to the input field
- check the input number with the secret number
- see the highest score on the web page
- reset the game
